## Objective

Understand promises and how to use them.
Learn how to use async/await for asynchronous operations.
Fetch data from APIs using fetch.
Use setTimeout to handle delays in JavaScript

# Instructions

## Part 1: Promises

Create and Use a Promise:
Create a promises.js file.
Create a promise that resolves successfully with a message and log the resolved message.
Create a promise that gets rejected and log the error message.

## Part 2: Async/Await
Use Async/Await for Asynchronous Operations:
Create an asyncAwait.js file.
Create an async function that fetches data from an API and logs the data.
Handle any potential errors using try/catch.

## Part 3: Fetching Data from APIs
Fetch Data from an API:
In the asyncAwait.js file, create an async function that fetches data from the provided API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1) and logs the data.

## Part 4: Using setTimeout
Create Delays in Code Execution:
Create a setTimeout.js file.
Use setTimeout to log a message after a delay of 2 sec
